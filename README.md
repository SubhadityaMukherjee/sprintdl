# SprintDL

- A convenience wrapper over Pytorch
- Faster research and experimentation
- Based on [fastai](https://github.com/fastai)
- Not tooo high level and meant only for the "bit" advanced researcher
- (This library is not stable right now. Everything works of course, but they will be changed and rearranged eventually)

## Documentation
- Check demo.ipynb for initial example
- There will be blogs on the topics that were required and [more here](https://www.subhadityamukherjee.me/)
- [Function documentation](https://subhadityamukherjee.github.io/sprintdl/)
- More will be added soon along with proper documentation

## Why
- I loved fastai, but in many things didnt agree with the way they went. I also needed some extra features that might have not ever been approved
- I wanted to learn DL even better. Thanks to the fastai course, I could do that. What better way to learn than make a whole library?
- On my way to be a better researcher, I have to take apart the things I take for granted. So, heres the cure for it.

## Thank you
- A huge huge huge huge thank you to [Jeremy Howard](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=jeremy%20howard), [Rachel Thomas](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=rachel+thomas&btnG=&oq=rachel+th), [Sylvian Gugger](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=S+gugger&btnG=) and the whole fastai team for just being absolutely amazing and helpful

## Contributions
- Feel free to suggest requests or changes. Especially if I have made any mistakes
- Unlike the original fastai, this is just by me. Mainly for my research. In the spirit of open source, I wanted to share it here :)
