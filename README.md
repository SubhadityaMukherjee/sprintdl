# SprintDL

- A convenience wrapper over Pytorch
- Faster research and experimentation
- Based on [fastai](https://github.com/fastai)
- Not tooo high level and meant only for the "bit" advanced researcher
- Many many convenience functions that one would need
- (This library is not stable right now. Everything works of course, but they will be changed and rearranged eventually)

# Features
- Check features.md for a full list

## Documentation
- Okay so writing examples will take forever, so please check function documentation and the demos folder for most of what you need
- Check the syntax folder for documentation
- Check demos folder
- [Function documentation](https://subhadityamukherjee.github.io/sprintdl/)
- There will be blogs on the topics that were required and [more here](https://www.subhadityamukherjee.me/)

## Why
- I loved fastai, but in many things didnt agree with the way they went. I also needed some extra features that might have not ever been approved
- I wanted to learn DL even better. Thanks to the fastai course, I could do that. What better way to learn than make a whole library?
- On my way to be a better researcher, I have to take apart the things I take for granted. So, heres the cure for it.

## Reqs
- pip install -r requirements.txt
